    This is the first project in the course. It tests the ability to use the very fundamental
    concepts of the introduction to Java: structuring code into methods that carry out specific
    tasks according to SOLID principles, variable declaration, implementing interacive code,
    etc.
    
    The task is to create an interactive program that asks the user various practical questions
    about the planned trip and gives answers.
